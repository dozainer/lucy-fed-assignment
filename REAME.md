### LUCY Frontend Developer Assessment

We want to assess your skill as a Frontend developer. To do so we are asking you to complete the
simple exercise that is described below. For the project you need to use React and TypeScript,
dependencies are up to you.

Using the Rick & Morty API (rickandmortyapi.com) display the profiles of the characters (either with
pagination or showing the first page only).

The profile of a character should include:

- Image
- Character information (name, species, etc).
- Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).
- Name of the chapters the character is featured on.

We also appreciate testing. In our projects we use Jest, React Testing Library and [MSW](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-server) (it is a great
library for API mocking). Please, consider both successful and failure scenarios.

_Bonus points:_

- Not using `any` (consider `unknown` instead).
- Not using CSS-Frameworks (they are unnecessary for this small project).
- Responsive design.
- Live demo link.

The API provides REST and GraphQL interfaces, for this assessment you should use the REST version.
The code should be posted on your public repository.
Write the code with production standards in mind.
